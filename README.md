# ReactQuotes_RoutingAdvanced

### Overview
This is a simple "Quotes" app I created that stored "Famous Quotes" or quotes from the public's creation. I built this app implementing "_single page application_" with React Routing, thus allowing different URL paths without having to leave the browser and send more Http requests. I utilize [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)'s realtime database to send and fetch quotes and quote comments data.


### Technologies
* React, JavaScript
* ReactRouter libraries 
* _Suspense, Switch, Prompt, Redirect, BrowserRouter, Route, NavLink and Link_ components
* _useRouteMatch, useHistory, useLocation, useParams_ custom hooks
* _path, exact, and to_ built-in props
* query parameters (_?_) with React Router
* URLSearchParams (_JS constructor func_)
* [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) 



### How to Run
This app is currently only ran locally. Just do the usual steps:
* git clone the repo
* npm start 

### Lessons Learned
This app taught me about setting up a project with multi-page domains / path URLs while still maintaining that React effect of "_Single Page Application_". This project was built with the assistance of a Udemy course that taught the _React framework_ ( 48+ hours ).
