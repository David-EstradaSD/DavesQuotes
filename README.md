# ReactQuotes_RoutingAdvanced

### Overview
This is a simple "Quotes" app I created that stored "Famous Quotes" or quotes from the public's creation. I built this app implementing "_single page application_" with React Routing, thus allowing different URL paths without having to leave the browser and send more Http requests.

### Technologies
* React, JavaScript
* ReactRouter libraries 
* _Switch, Prompt, Redirect, BrowserRouter, Route, NavLink and Link_ components
* _useHistory, useParams_ custom hooks
* _path, exact, and to_ built-in props


### How to Run
This app is currently only ran locally. Just do the usual steps:
* git clone the repo
* npm start 

### Lessons Learned
This app taught me about setting up a project with multi-page domains / path URLs while still maintaining that React effect of "_Single Page Application_". This project was built with the assistance of a tutorial through Udemy that taught the _React framework_ ( 48+ hours ).
